# Teams:

###Run team





Antonina: This week, I attempted to continue working on scenes, mainly transitions once the player had a collision with a block with was designed to kill the player, but I was unable to work on this because I needed collisions to be implemented in the code before I could work on this. I tried to help Fiona implement Marie's collision class to the code, but I was unsuccessful.  


Marie: Unfortunately, I was not able to fix the issue on my own computer, so I downloaded everything on a separate computer. This weeks goal is to code a countdown clock which will appear on the upper right corner of the screen.



Fiona: This week I didn't know what to do because I needed collison to work in order to make changes about how the player reacts to different objects. I tried to implement Marie's collision class to the code but I didn't manage to do so.


Antoine Majoie: My windows laptop crashed this week, so I have been trying to make SFML work on my Mac during the TD, after spending 4 hours with the TA, SFML was still not working. I made sure that I was up to date with the code that was written so that I the implementation of the texutres and sounds could be facilitated.
