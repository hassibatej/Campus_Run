###UI design



Marie: This week, I worked on implementing continuous character motion for the CampusRun: The Run Section and player animation (i.e. what happens when the character encounters an object that kills them). Next week, I hope to be able to have this synced with the kill object class and complete build the maps for the 2 CR: TheRun Urban and Jungle maps.


Fiona: This week I got a basic SFML cpp code running on my mac using Qt and learned how to use the CmakeFile.txt. I wrote a tutorial on how I did it so that other mac users can do it.



Antonina: I did some more research on object collisions and scene switching, but I did not begin to code it. I tried to make Qt Creator work with cmake and SFML following Fiona's instructions, but I was unable to do so. 


### Game engine development


Antoine Babu: This week I mainly worked on merging code blocks with Eve. In terms of features, I implemented pop-ups and am still working on their interactive capabilities.



Antoine Majoie:



Eve Margolis:


This week I primarily focused on merging code blocks with Antoine B. I also further worked on the coins and coin counter in the context of our new coding framework.I also worked on the basics of the inventory and items the character would interact with in the first level.Next week I will finalize these aspects.




Rojin Radmehr:
This week I made the text interactions that the player has when they interact with an object ( for example when clicked on an object, they are asked if they want to put that object in their inventory). Next week I will work on the transition between different floors.



Hassiba Tej: I worked on implementing the health and damage bars classes in order to make the game more interractive and looked up some designs that can be added. Furthermore, as I'm working on the dungeons game part, I continued on the work I had to do.
