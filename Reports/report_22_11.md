#Report for the week of November 15th 2021


#Teams:
###UI design



Marie: This week, I worked on implementing continuous character motion for the CampusRun: The Run Section and player animation (i.e. what happens when the character encounters an object that kills them). Next week, I hope to be able to have this synced with the kill object class and complete build the maps for the 2 CR: TheRun Urban and Jungle maps.


Fiona: This week I got a basic SFML cpp code running on my mac using Qt and learned how to use the CmakeFile.txt. I wrote a tutorial on how I did it so that other mac users can do it.



Antonina: I did some more research on object collisions and scene switching, but I did not begin to code it. I tried to make Qt Creator work with cmake and SFML following Fiona's instructions, but I was unable to do so. 


### Game engine development


Antoine Babu: This week I mainly worked on merging code blocks with Eve. In terms of features, I implemented pop-ups and am still working on their interactive capabilities.
