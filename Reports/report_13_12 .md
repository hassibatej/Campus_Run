#  Report for the week of December 13th 2021


# Teams:

###Run team





Antonina: This week, I worked on making sure the code would run on my computer. I worked with both the TAs and Fiona to do this and, in the end, was able to see the map on my computer and could write code on my own computer rather than someone else's.




Marie: This week, my computer encountered some errors as a result of it updating. I could no longer get the code to work with Qt and am uncertain as to how to fix it. Hopefully, I can fix this issue by next week and thus be able to finish collision. 



Fiona: This week, I continued to look at ways to optimize the map but I mainly tried to help Antonina have the code work on their computer following the instructions I had wrote. By the end, Antonina could see the map on her computer


Antoine Majoie: This week my grandfather passed away, I was not able to do much progress as I was not in a right mental state. Nonetheless, I have continued to research on paralax view and the potential implementation of sound.

Rojin Radmehr:
This week I worked on the optimization of the text to be able to move to the next part of thext with a press of a key, but I was unsuccessful. Next week I will work on the end screens for when the player either wins or loses.
