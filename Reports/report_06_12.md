#  Report for the week of December 6th 2021


# Teams:

###Run team





Antonina: This week, I had some issues with my computer as I was unable to run code since QT stopped working for me. I tried to fix this by reopening all our files from the beginning, but it still didn't work. I hope to ask the TAs for help with this on Thursday so I am able to run code before break. Otherwise, I worked some more on player interactions with an object, specifically so that the player would now be transported to the next level once they hit it, but I still need to test if it works once I fix QT. I hope to implement this to the main code on Git by the end of this week and to begin working on specific scenes such as 'you died/won' messages.

Marie: This week I almost completed the Collision header and class. Some tests need to be completed but the player should now be able to stand on platforms and interact with objects. I also recoded for constant motion in x-direction. This week i hope to work on developing further the player-object interactions.


Fiona: This week, I worked on optimizing the map I have created last week for the 'Run' part of our project. I also coded a class of obstacles which will be either deadly or slow the player down when the player touches them. They appear on the screen an any position we want to give them. 
We will also be able to use them as exit objects (to signal the end of the level)


Antoine Majoie: I have managed to implement a working camera, I have also started to look at a paralax view to have a dynamic background. I have started to have several layers of background so that the atmosphere of the game is improved.




### Dungeon team

Antoine Babu:




Eve Margolis: This week I worked on merging the codes of the two sections and di not finalize it, but will work on doing that this upcoming week. I further worked on developing some of the functions I was in charge of, such as the inventory and items, but did not finalize them as I want to be able to implement them into the merged code which is not finalized yet. Once the merge is finalized though, all of this should be relatively feasible.




Rojin Radmehr:
This week I worked on the main menu and how to implement the buttons. Next week I will work on omptimization of the text implementation.
