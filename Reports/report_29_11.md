#Report for the week of November 29th 2021


#Teams:

###UI design

Marie:This week, I coded the Collision header and class. These will be utilised to detect player and object interactions and allow us to assign particular actions depending on the object the player is colliding with (i.e. die or be pushed back or slowed down ect.). Next week, I aim to complete this class and be able to apply it to 3 different object types.



Fiona: This week, I coded a map for the 'run' part of the game by writing the Tile and Tilemap classes. They work and we can now have a ground and platforms. I also started working on obstacles. The structure is there but the code doesn't work yet. I will keep working on this issue and solve it before the next TD session


Antonina: This week, I coded the classes Scene and SceneState, which will allow us to switch between levels and menus, but I haven't committed them to the main code yet as I had some issues opening it on my computer. Next week, I will begin working introducing a new feature to the tiles which "teleports" the player when they cross it, allowing us to use player position/action to switch between levels. 




### Game engine development

Eve Margolis:
This week I spent most of the TD section trying to 'clean' the code we have so as to make sure we were not implementing superficial elements. I then worked more on the inventory for the character which should theoretically be transferable for all the levels, as well as implemented a double jump feature. I will continue working on items of our first level next week as well as focus on implementing the additional interesting aspects to make it more complete.


Rojin Radmehr:

This week I made the transition pages that come when the players wants to move to a new floor.Next week I will work on optimization of the transition page.


Hassiba Tej:
Worked on relations between classes and looking more in deepth at the gravity and way of deplacement of the player.
