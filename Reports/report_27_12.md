 f#  Report for the week of December the 27th 2021



Antonina: This week, I stopped working on the cat code (which us Mac users had been coding on) and began working with Rojin on team dungeon's code, which we have decided would be the main code for the game. I worked with her to finish implementing scenes, such as creating a GameOver and Won screens, and focused on controlling screen transitions by player movement, ie if a player hit a killing type tile object then they would die and the GameOver screen would be showed. I worked on the TileMap and Game classes for this transition part individually as well as the classes dedicated the individual scenes with Rojin.  



Marie: This week, Antoine and I worked on sound effect (i.e. the sound the player makes when he jumps), background music, and transition scene sound effect as well as setting the background for different sections of the game.



Fiona: This week, I stopped working on the map I had created using Cmake on my mac and worked on Windows with Eve to continue building the map she had started and finish it. We created types of Tiles to have killing objects and flags, we used a text file system to make the map efficient and the map building easier. We then wrote the file representing the map by giving each tile a position, type, texture, and collision boolean.

Antoine Majoie: I went back to Belgium over the break with the hope to get my windows laptop fixed. Unfortunatley, as my parents have COVID, I am a contact case, and cannot leave the house. I therefore tried to implement SFML on our family laptop, I am encountering several buggs. I kept working on the music and 3D sound space research in the mean time. Next week, if my old windows still does not work I will get it fixed in Paris as soon as I get back to campus.

Rojin Radmehr:
This week I worked on the text that works as a tutorial for the game and appears when the game starts. Next week I will re-do some of the previous functions so that they will work better and fix small bugs that they have.
