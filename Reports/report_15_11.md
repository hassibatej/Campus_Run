#Report for the week of November 15th 2021

###UI design


Marie: This week, we continued to try to get a software to work with our computers to allow us to visualise the game. We tried cmake and Godot. We decided that Godot was incompatible with our objectives. I also started furthering the work done last week for the camera (particularly making sure that it followed the player) with Antoine. Next week, I hope to have completed the camera and the problem with the compatibility of iOS with the programs we intend on using to develop our game.


Fiona: This week, I worked on setting up Godot for mac. I tried to look at the bindings for c++ in Godot.I contacted a student to get some information about the platform and had a meeting with him after which we made the group decision of abandonning Godot. I thus swiched tasks and tried to adapt our code for mac users by downloading CMake and SFML in Qt. I have managed to make Qt recognise SFML but I still have some errors with building which I have adressed on Slack.


Antonina: This week, I worked on researching Godot for mac, such as downloading the necessary libraries and folders to be able to code in cpp using Godot. Unfortunately, we found that we would be unable to use Godot for the project as it wasn't a feasible option for everyone, so I switched my focus to downloading a virtual machine and checking that I would be able to run Windows on my computer. It isn't the fastest option, but it will hopefully allow me to run the code on my system and begin coding. I also did more research on switching between screens/maps for the game itself.


### Game engine development

Antoine Babu: This week I worked on implementing the missing features to catch up with the pace we set for ourselves. This notably includes map handling, which will allow us to start creating levels. I've started to look into menus and GUI as we have several features which require to be implemented in a similar fashion.


Antoine Majoie: This week, the TA mentioned that Godot could be a good for Mac and Windows. As I have both I was able to download the appropriate libraries on Mac and Windows with Fiona and Antonina. However we concluded that Godot was not a viable option. We then turned to Unreal Engine, compatible with both Mac and Windows as well, however as a specific version of iOS was required we again concluded that Unreal Engine was not a viable option for the group to turn to. I have made progress on the camera and was able to make an SFML file function on Mac (one that is independent from the Cat Code). Next week I hope to have an enitrely functional camera.



Eve Margolis:
This week, I solved slight issues I had with the coin counter we wished to implement.I also started working on the pause menu, and created a few new classes about the game state. I will aim to finish this next week and further develop the project implementation.


Rojin Radmehr:

This week, since we had problems with mac computers, i spend some time searching for a solution and then spend the rest of the week trying to understand godot.
Next week I will help implement the first level of the game.

Hassiba Tej: This week, I started to think on how to implement the transitions between the sprites during the game, how to update the changes. Also I've been working on the global game, how it should be implemented and the global game experience.
