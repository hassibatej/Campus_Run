###UI design


Marie: This week, we continued to try to get a software to work with our computers to allow us to visualise the game. We tried cmake and Godot. We decided that Godot was incompatible with our objectives. I also started furthering the work done last week for the camera (particularly making sure that it followed the player) with Antoine. Next week, I hope to have completed the camera and the problem with the compatibility of iOS with the programs we intend on using to develop our game.


Fiona: This week, I worked on setting up Godot for mac. I tried to look at the bindings for c++ in Godot.I contacted a student to get some information about the platform and had a meeting with him after which we made the group decision of abandonning Godot. I thus swiched tasks and tried to adapt our code for mac users by downloading CMake and SFML in Qt. I have managed to make Qt recognise SFML but I still have some errors with building which I have adressed on Slack.


Antonina: This week, I worked on researching Godot for mac, such as downloading the necessary libraries and folders to be able to code in cpp using Godot. Unfortunately, we found that we would be unable to use Godot for the project as it wasn't a feasible option for everyone, so I switched my focus to downloading a virtual machine and checking that I would be able to run Windows on my computer. It isn't the fastest option, but it will hopefully allow me to run the code on my system and begin coding. I also did more research on switching between screens/maps for the game itself.


### Game engine development

Antoine Babu:



Antoine Majoie: This week I have been working on several aspects of the game including the camera with SFML on Visual Studio. I have successfully managed to make sure that the camera followed a player in both the x and y directions. Moreover, I have managed to understand and implement in SFML how to make an object that the camera will not follow as well as an object that will be a part of the screen (for this object could be a health bar or a coin counter). As my 'newer' laptop is a Mac ('older' laptop is windows), I also worked on the setting up Godot for Mac with C++, however after spending 3 hours on the research and implementation and will a lack of satisfactory results, we concluded that Godot would be qutie complicated for Macs. This week I will work on my windows laptop and make sure that the camera follows the player in the x direction only and create a small version of a map for the player to interact with.



Eve Margolis:
This week, I solved slight issues I had with the coin counter we wished to implement.I also started working on the pause menu, and created a few new classes about the game state. I will aim to finish this next week and further develop the project implementation.


Rojin Radmehr:

This week, since we had problems with mac computers, i spend some time searching for a solution and then spend the rest of the week trying to understand godot.
Next week I will help implement the first level of the game.

Hassiba Tej: This week, I started to think on how to implement the transitions between the sprites during the game, how to update the changes. Also I've been working on the global game, how it should be implemented and the global game experience.
