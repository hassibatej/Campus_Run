## 1. Project Description 

Campus Run intends to implement a 'Geometry Dash' like game, using graphics inspired
from the campus most famous spots (namely the Lake and the SPIS truck) and allow the player to navigate and the map, making sure to survive as he goes forward and
eventually, complete the game.

### 1.1. History :
Hello! Welcome to Campus Run! 
You are a Bachelor student in the Building 103. You open your refrigerator and realize that you only have an egg on your shelf. You look at your flatmate’s shelf and he has a slice of bacon. It looks so delicious and you are so hungry that you choose to steal it. 
As it is sizzling in your pan, your flatmate comes into the kitchen and catches you red-handed, cooking his bacon. 
While you are both arguing, your slice of bacon burns to a crisp and your fire alarm goes off. There is no fire, but the alarm won’t stop ringing. Both your phone and your flatmate’s phone have no charge. However you know that the SPIS will yell at you if they come to your flat just because you burnt your piece of bacon…
Therefore, you decide to run to the SPIS station to warn them that the fire is under control.
